# yuga
This is a php framework that utilizes code reusability even in the views by using the popular mvvm pattern

# Getting started is simple
just clone https://github.com/hsemix/yuga-app.git
Then type composer install, and then run you server inside of the yuga-app folder or copy files in the yuga folder and take them inside the xampp htdocs folder. Either way you should see the starter page for the framework
